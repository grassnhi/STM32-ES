# Lab 1: General Purpose Input Output 

- Ex1: Control led3 ON in 2s and then OFF in 4s.

- Ex2: Ex1 with 1 delay statement (use counter and an extra variable to save the led status).

- Ex3: Simulate the traffic light operation using led2, led_y0 and led_y1.

# Lab 2: Timer Interrupt and LED Scanning

- Ex1: Use software timer to:
    + Toogle led3 every 2s.
    + Turn led_y0 on 2s and turn led_y1 off 4s.
    + Turn led_y0 on 5s and turn led_y1 off 1s.

- Ex2: Simulate the traffic light in lab 1 using software timer.

- Ex3: Change LED_7SEG frequency to 1Hz, 25Hz, 100Hz.

- Ex4: Simulus the digital 7-segment LED.

- Ex5: Display 4 different number in the LED_7SEG and shift them right every 1s.
